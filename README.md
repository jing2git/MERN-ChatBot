MERN-ChatBot
This is my first project, a basic and simple chatbot built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I created it with the help of tutorials from @Indian Coder.

This is my first step into full-stack development project. The chatbot handles basic functions and user interaction, showcasing what i have learned so far about building web application. The basic setup for this project are

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data. Express.js: Web framework for Node.js. React: Frontend library for building user interfaces. Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend development.

Since this is my first project, I'm open to suggestions and improvements. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

A huge thank you to @Indian Coder for the amazing tutorials that helped me build this project.
